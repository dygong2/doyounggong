abstract: This study investigates what competency matters for citizens’ identification of false information in disasters and emergencies. False information, produced and disseminated via media, can generate social confusion and lead to an inadequate response during disasters and emergencies. Considering that the current media environment requires information recipients to have a certain degree of competency to judge the trustworthiness of information, the existing literature does not provide a systematic understanding of what constitutes individuals’ ability to identify false information related to disasters and emergencies. Using a national survey of public access to false information related to a disaster and an emergency, this study examines the effects of media channel use, digital literacy, social participation, and trust in government on the ability to identify false information during disasters and emergencies. The findings suggest public authorities or emergency managers could better provide consistent and accurate information in a way that requires less digital literacy and further improves the public’s confidence in government regarding the exchange of risk information with the public.
